<p><span class="drop-cap">S</span>omething, somewhere, long ago, told me Missouri was a miserable, uninhabitable place. Like Dorothy’s farm in Kansas. Like a Grapes of Wrath dust bowl. When I thought of Missouri, I thought of Mississippi. Except, instead of Mississippi’s swamp land, I thought of Arkansas’s endless plains. I thought of wheat fields and tornados. I thought of soot-filled rivers and impoverished towns. I did not, however, think of cities. I especially did not think of cities like Kansas City or St. Louis. Cities may have been nearby, but I refused to believe any such city could be found in Missouri.</p>

<p>Perhaps I knew the real Kansas City wasn’t in Kansas. Perhaps Kansas City was in Missouri, but it wasn’t originally from Missouri. In my mind, Kansas City and all its buildings were purchased from somewhere else and shipped across state borders on an ‘Oversized Load’ trailer. Perhaps I really thought St. Louis was traded for Kansas City, and somehow St. Louis was shipped to New Hampshire or Nebraska or one of those states we know is a state, but we’re sometimes skeptical. We think St. Louis is the same kind of place as New Hampshire — the kind of place which is nice, but is no one’s choice destination. Instead, that kind of place is Missouri, and I hadn’t realized it yet.</p>

<p>Eris and I drove across the Eads Bridge on our way up from Atlanta. We drove along the bridge across the Mississippi River. We drove from the east and crossed into the west. We drove until the road was no longer I64, but became Washington Avenue. Exactly as we crossed the river, I saw The Gateway Arch and murmured to myself, confused, “This is Missouri?”</p>

<p>I didn’t realize St. Louis was in Missouri. In my mind, I was driving to Missouri, not to St. Louis. My realization was a stupid-man’s epiphany. It was disorienting in the same way exiting from the alternate side of an elevator is disorienting. I exited not where I entered, not realizing there were two sides. I must have spent the first hour of the trip in denial. “This can’t be Missouri. It’s so big, so nice. And it has THE arch. I thought Kansas City had the arch. And since when is Kansas City in Missouri? I didn’t know Missouri had two cities. I didn’t know Missouri had any cities.” </p>

<p>This was supposed to be Missouri. Instead, it was what I believed to be Kansas City, which was actually St. Louis, both of which are cities in Missouri, but neither of which is where I expected us to arrive. What a delightful surprise. I was expecting Missouri; St. Louis is so much better. </p>

<p>St. Louis is a city. Not a town. Not a suburb. A city. That’s the simplest way I can explain my befuddlement. That said, nothing <em>truly</em> tragic ever afflicted our road trip. So, don’t hold your breath. There’s no need for it. Nothing to see here. Just two clumsy friends making their way across the continent.
Within our first minute in St. Louis, we encountered the trip’s first trial: a rusted-out 1970s sedan driving recklessly and straight for us. We were in my Prius on Lucas Avenue, waiting like a frog to hopscotch across North Broadway, across four lanes of one-way traffic so we could reach our hotel’s parking deck at the intersection of 4th Avenue. </p>

<p>4th Avenue is the city’s first street; it runs along the river, along the city’s eastern shore. In fact, we had already arrived at 4th Avenue just before driving past it. Since 4th Avenue is the city’s first street, it’s also the city’s first turn. And the two of us, figuring we’d cross into the city before making any turns, missed our first and only turn at the entrance of the city.</p>

<p>Now we were turned-around and driving back east up Lucas Avenue, waiting for a hole in the traffic so we could take our car across Broadway, and return, again, to 4th Avenue. That’s when the 1970s sedan came barrelling towards us. That’s when the honking started. That’s when the FUs were cited. That’s moments before we were parked in our first city. </p>

<p>Everything else is an anachronistic blur, so rather than detailing the timeline, I’ll note the most vivid memories. First, the hotel: Missouri Athletic Club. </p>

<p>We entered with our two bags, me in my t-shirt, which hung around my ass like a dress, and Eris in her t-shirt, which likely alluded to Georgia Tech’s robotics team. I’m mentioning our shirts because the first word from the check-in desk is, “Our dress-code requires a collared shirt and jacket, except on weekends or weekdays when there’s a game.” Followed by, “Tonight there is a game.” </p>

<p>“So we don’t need to worry about the dress code?”</p>

<p>“Not tonight you don’t.” And then she hands us our room keys and receipt: ‘One night at Missouri Athletic Club, $95.98’.
My point to Eris was, “Did she really need to tell us about the dress code if we weren’t staying when the dress code applied? What if I need a pillow in the middle of the night? Must I button my tux just to ask the concierge for extra linens?” </p>

<p>Eris shrugged.</p>

<p>The second memory is of my multi-thousand-dollar Sony camera, and the array of multi-thousand-dollar lenses accompanying my Sony camera. I felt as much obligation to use the camera as I felt fear for not breaking or losing any of its parts. I would later succumb to my fears and quit using the camera entirely, but since today was day one in our first city, I brought my 18mm wide-angle, and we were off to the streets. </p>

<p>It was a falling sun when we arrived in the late afternoon. There was enough daylight so all of the city was open, but it was late enough for businesses to wind down, and for the many beleaguered workers to relieve themselves at the street-side saloon. The sun was warm, but not hot. And the sky was clear, but not free of clouds. It all made for wonderful photography, but without a plan for which shots to take or why I’d be taking them, I aimlessly exhausted myself picturing just about everything. I came not to see all that much, nor to enjoy very much our wandering — but I filled my camera’s memory card, fast.
We arrived at The Gateway Arch, and though we weren’t determined to take the elevator to the top, we quickly became determined to take the elevator to the top. </p>

<p>Sometimes, and sporadically, America amazes me. The United States of America can, and not all that frequently, achieve this world’s most absurd feats. Truly. </p>

<p>Admittedly, China has its sky-scrapers and bridges. Brazil has its Redeemer. London has its Ferris Wheel. France has its four-legged radio antenna. But all those super-structures have very different ideological purposes — all of which are mostly practical. China constructs to expand and strengthen their single party; Brazil celebrates, for some reason, the religion of their conquistadors; Britain is still selling their pallid patrons on ‘Outdoor Time’; France had its way with modern technology and defaulted to another place for food. It’s all so predictable. Then there’s America. We’re number one. </p>

<p>We’re not number one because we are actually number one. No. There’s always someone else better at something else. Instead, we’re number one because we believe we are number one. We believe we are number one so fully, we’ve convinced the world to believe it too. We’ve created the world’s strongest brand, and it’s called the United States of America. </p>

<p>As a United brand, we trademarked freedom. We trademarked democracy. And despite neither of those philosophical inventions belonging to us, and despite not effectively using either freedom or democracy, we still celebrate our brand as if we did. And look at the products our brand now sells:</p>

<p>We sell consumerism. We sell entrepreneurship. We sell dreams. We invented the insatiable lust for material welfare. We promised anyone the pursuit of happiness, not just for the rich and powerful. Anyone. *Any man. *Any white man.</p>

<p>Admittedly, America is far from free, and America is far from democratic. Perhaps, if we were both free and democratic, black persons and hispanic persons, asian persons and indigenous persons, female persons and gender-free persons, all persons, equally under the law, would enjoy equal freedoms under the law, and would enjoy equal opportunity to change the law to favor themselves as equally as their counterparts would enjoy opportunity to change the laws to favor themselves; this is democratic citizenship — equal opportunity to effectively voice the preferences of self.</p>

<p>Yet, as troubled as our United brand may seem, when standing under The Gateway Arch, when considering the enormous slabs of concrete and steel to support an entirely suspended arch, when walking underground into an enormous bunker directly beneath the arch, when riding both vertically and laterally, simultaneously, in an elevator-pod calculated entirely with pencil and paper, when reaching the top and watching fat persons and skinny persons alike, rich persons and poor persons alike, shoulder-to-shoulder and stupefied at the sights before them, when considering why we’d have the world’s smartest engineers build the country’s greatest feat in the middle of nowhere, when considering all these considerations, something of America’s truest essence bleeds through to the surface of our hearts. The truest essence of freedom is manifested here, at The Gateway Arch, as blind, true freedom. This kind of freedom defiantly rebukes all doubt and skepticism, all fear and insanities, and simply replies, “We built this because we could, because to stop ourselves would slight our freedom.” </p>

<p>The final memory of St. Louis is my favorite memory of St. Louis. I vowed my last picture at dusk, and Eris and I rested in our room at The Athletic Club. My camera was left behind, and I could finally see. We walked to an asian restaurant — the road-trip’s first of many asian meals. Then we walked to Busch Stadium to see the Cardinals play. Then we walked some more. Walked to a park. Walked down Washington Avenue. Walked back to our hotel room. We walked throughout the city, and while we were walking we waved “Hello” to passerbys. We said, “How do you do,” “Howdy,” as if we knew each other, or as if we would see each other again. We loitered here and there. We were in no rush, and there was never any real distraction. There were few cars. No taxis. No public transit. At least, the public transit wasn’t distracting enough to notice. People were headed this way and that way, popping in-and-out of shoppes and bars. If there were pretty people around me, I had forgotten all about them. I was already love-drunk on what it meant to feel free in a city, aimlessly strolling without worry of obstructing anybody’s way, least of all my own. </p>

<p>After dinner, Eris and I decided on the ballpark. And I was excited to see the game already underway. It was the bottom of the second before we signed our dinner tabs. We strolled. We strolled down long avenues, standing for a time in the middle of the street, expressing our dominance over traffic, the traffic all parked in someone else’s garage. We strolled some more until we arrived. </p>

<p>I greeted the ticket-booth with twenty dollars. The gent handed me two general admission tickets. No receipt. No change. Nothing to sign. An even exchange. Two seats; twenty bucks.</p>

	<figcaption>Admission was ten dollars in the top of the third; the sun set somewhere in the sixth, and we were gone before the stretch.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Then we waltzed through the gate, up an infinite set of stairs to the top-most section of right field. We sat for a time and watched the last bit of sun drain away from the sky. By the seventh-inning we were on our way out. I can’t say we watched a single play. Eris hadn’t a clue what was happening, and I hadn’t a clue how to tell her I didn’t care. We sat there enjoying America’s greatest pastime in, perhaps, America’s greatest city. By morning, Eris was driving, and we were headed north, towards Chicago.</p>
