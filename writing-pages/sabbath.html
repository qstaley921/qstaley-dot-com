    <article class="long-article">
      <p><span class="drop-cap">T</span>here are times when thinking peeves me. Sounds peeve me. The whole world is a thumbtack in the tissue of my brain or acid welling at the base of my esophagus. The very grumbling from my fasting stomach makes me want to scream, but the sounds of my screams make me want to die, but the thought of death makes me sick to my stomach, so I begin again with more grumblings. </p>

      <p>God is bliss. Meditate with God in bliss. What, then, is amiss? Bliss is far away. Incense is here to stay. I want to die.</p>

      <p>So I’m told, I must erode the ego day-by-day. Don’t defend yourself. Don’t prove others wrong. Don’t chase fame and fortune. Don’t chase material desires. You know it’s a shallow pleasure to enjoy any of it. We’re not trying for shallow pleasures. We’ve already fallen for those illusions; we dove headfirst into those pools, only to crack our skulls immediately upon indulging the water. We must forgo the many shallow places knowing an expansive ocean is beyond the way. We must escape our ego. </p>

      <p>When we do, when we try to dissolve the ego, any progress will make our ego desperate and bitter, and so we will become desperate and bitter. </p>

      <p>By the time any true advancement is made against the ego, it has already turned fatalistic and has undermined all our work by convincing you you’re wrong. Soon, you come to doubt yourself, you come to believe this most righteous path you were on is actually a facade and an elaborate scheme by gullible fools. “If you want to be a renunciant in some ashram,” says the ego, “have at it. But that’s no way to live your life. Don’t you want to earn a living, have kids and a beautiful wife? Look at all the purchases you’ve enjoyed over the years. You’ll lose all those treasures without me.” </p>

      <p>The ego is convincing. But remember. The ego is fatalistic. The ego conflates happiness with joy, pleasure with peace. The former of each, happiness and pleasure, is a temporary state which must forever be fed, furnished, and maintained. The latter, joy and peace, is a permanent state achieved without reliance on happiness and pleasure. </p>

      <p>Your ego works to save you from immediate pain. The ego says, “Clearly this new path to undermine me is proving needlessly difficult. Why strain towards inconceivable solutions. Look around. No one is trying to do what you are doing, and when you look again you’ll see how no one is suffering as much as you are suffering. Can’t we agree it’s in vain. Please,” the ego begs of you, “I can make you happy right this very moment, if you just work with me again.” But the ego is never working for you. No. The ego is working forever on behalf of itself, on behalf of surviving by forcing you to identify with it and to identify with happiness and pleasure. You are the host to its parasitic nature.</p>

      <p>“You can’t kill me without killing yourself as well,” warns the ego. It’s just not true, yet we cannot remember any other experience except for our experience identified with our material bodies, professions, environments, and relationships—which is all the many forms of the ego. </p>

      <p>My question: <em>Can I take a moment away from God , from meditation, from life and the pursuit of who I am, can I take a small reprieve without negating the work I’ve done?</em> Moreover, can my brief reprieve bring progress amid turmoil? Is the sabbath the one day when I refuse the ego at all costs, no matter the woes of the week? Or is the sabbath the one day when I indulge the ego, so that I might remind myself how shallow it really is? </p>

      <p>My continued troubles must mean something for the daily actions I take. The pains must point to some fault of my own. </p>

      <p>A fault in my behavior? I must find it. But where? Perhaps my joy. I’ve not laughed so much of recent. I’ve been, at times, impertinent. And what’s the antidote? God’s love. Blissful ambivalence. Compassion. Humor. Forgiving amusement. I might find this through mental reframing, but what must I reframe?</p>

      <p>“Oh, your dog peed on the rug. How silly animals are. Let’s discuss a better way forward.”</p>

      <p>“Oh, the fridge is amok with wasted food. Let’s have a genuine council about food management.” </p>

      <p>Except, I cannot change others. I must change myself. So I ask, “Why are my reactions to these incredulities so aggravating?” </p>

      <p>Most simply, they corrupt my own values. They show, in deeply consequential terms, the resulting woes of poor continence, poor discipline, and our inability to palliate pleasure. </p>

      <p>For our dog soiling our carpets is not the fault of the dog or our immediate oversight in letting the dog outside. No. The fault began much earlier in a far deeper place. </p>

      <p>One level deeper is our laziness in properly training the dog. Laziness is deeply rooted in the fear of our ego's appearance. When we're lazy, we’re avoiding the truth of our identity; we avoid knowing we’re less effective and less skilled at dog training than we hoped ourselves to be. Our fears for realizing the truth about ourselves prompts our “laziness” never to begin. </p>

      <p>Beyond the fault of fear, there’s the deeper fault of belief, for training a dog takes longer than what is immediately apparent. The reward is often delayed until subsequent efforts after many unsuccessful trials. The positive results are promised to us from the beginning, but they are not experienced until closer to the end. We must believe and have faith in an imaginary state we’ve not experienced before, all-the-while paying efforts to the cause, working without reward. </p>

      <p>In earnest, the rewards of dog training are, if not immediate, almost immediate. The deeper fault is not in patiently awaiting the rewards of training, nor in facing the shortcomings of the ego’s ability to train. No. The true fault speaks to why we first purchased the dog. The true fault is in perpetuating the results of good behavior after the rewards bore us. </p>

      <p>For once the dog makes a habit of a good thing, the achievement isn’t an accomplishment but an expected norm. The initial relief felt when the dog learns to pee on the lawn instead of the living room is only exciting in the beginning. Just as the initial excitement of a new puppy is only fanfare for a time. We subconsciously ask ourselves, “What is the reward in continuing to train a dog old tricks?” And we subconsciously answer, “Nothing. There is no new reward, and so the reward is no longer meaningful.”</p>

      <p>There’s no revealing old tricks to old friends. There’s no new challenge for the dog. There’s no more convenience added to your life. It’s merely maintaining the current state. Nothing is added. Nothing is new. We’re merely not regressing. As perfunctory as it sounds, however, most of us can’t do it. </p>

      <p>We clean the fridge only to neglect it in the coming days. We diet and lose weight only to eat fats and sugar tomorrow. We learn new skills only to ignore the knowledge when the situations arise to use and practice those skills. </p>

      <p>The deeper fault, and perhaps the deepest fault we have, is our insatiable pursuit of pleasure in the form of all we desire. The consequence is insatiable hunger, incorrigible restlessness, and indefinite suffering. </p>

      <p>I asked, initially, <em>should I make the sabbath a day when I refuse the ego at all costs, or day when I indulge the ego to remind me of the costs I’m making?</em> To indulge or to deny is not the task, however. Either is a pursuit with endless promises, rewards, and punishments when those promises are not kept. </p>

      <p>The task is to omit and denude, to seek absence of negativity versus the attainment of positivity, for the former is a state of equilibrium, balance, and equanimity, while the latter is a state of positivity, which by law is accompanied by a state of negativity. </p>

      <p>Cut-away the cancer and reveal the flesh below. Wash-away the dirt and reveal what’s forever clean. We are not actively working against the ego, for to feel the ego again means we’ve lost. Just as we are not working with the ego for hope of some relief, for when the relief subsides, we will have lost again. Instead, we are finding stillness, peace, and bliss in the eternal present state, no matter how miserable or happy we currently are. </p>

      <p>Our one tool is knowing our one fault: desiring an alternative state. Our resolution is neither working with nor against the desirable future states promised by our ego, pleasures, vices, and lives. We’re merely reminding ourselves to stop chasing matters that can let us down. Stop chasing. What’s left is all that's needed. </p>

      <p>So, to define the sabbath, may I realize the purpose of a sabbath. It's not to renounce the pleasures which have failed me, nor to indulge new pleasures to pall my woes. Instead, the sabbath is Thy weekly reminder to Be still. Stop desiring. Find some sense of peace which might inform your daily efforts and tasks. Forgive yourself of yesterday and tomorrow by starting anew this very moment. Comforting pain by hiding it in pleasure is but a momentary panacea, where true comfort is not found by escaping but accepting. God is not a diverging force, but a uniting force. Find union with pain and nothing will remain to do you harm. </p>
