<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>e started in Atlanta. Eris and I were staying at my father&apos;s house; that&apos;s where we lived. Naturally, that&apos;s where we began. </p>

<p>We were never tourists in Atlanta. Eris was a former Georgia Tech student, and I was taking classes at SCAD&apos;s Atlanta Campus. Not-to-mention, I was born and raised in Atlanta. At that, we omitted typical Atlanta festivities. No Grant Park Zoo, no World of Coke, no Civil Liberties Museum, no College Football Hall of Fame, no Braves games, not even a visit to Home Depot&apos;s Georgia Aquarium. We were natives ... sorta. We felt no need to further explore Atlanta. </p>

<p>Instead, we drove north towards Norcross. Our first stop was on Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, a Safelite AutoGlass shoppe. In the <em>book</em> version of this road-trip exposition, I detail — in detail — how my head met and broke the window of my Prius&apos;s driver-side door. If you want the full story, all the stories between the cities and these public-facing web-pages, you&apos;ll need to buy the book. But first, I&apos;ll need to finish writing the book. </p>

<p>So, carry-on. This is Atlanta. I don&apos;t know what you&apos;re still doing here; we&apos;re off to St. Louis.</p>
