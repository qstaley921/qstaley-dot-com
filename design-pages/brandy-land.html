      <p class="commentary-text">This project was in collaboration with my dear friend and international illustrator, Júlia Albuquerque. The process began in my intro anthropology class, starting with the question, &quot;<span class="bold-text-em">How do fraternities affect academic standing?</span>&quot;</p>

      <p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>e began this project in the Winter of 2020—back when 'COCO' was just a novelty. Back then we sat in &quot;live&quot; classes, which meant <em>in the flesh</em>, not just <em>realtime</em>. My intro anthropology professor was teaching us how to ask &quot;good&quot; questions. That's when I asked myself, &quot;I wonder if fraternities affect academic scholarship?&quot; </p>

      <p>Mind you, this thesis question is its evolved counterpart. It began with just me wanting to know if drinking/drugs/sex ever negatively affected a student's GPA. Because here I was, bored senseless, sober, and judiciously attending class at 10am. &quot;Surely,&quot; I hoped to myself, &quot;my staid social life is guaranteeing grades my fellow frat-brothers never dreamed of achieving.&quot; </p>

      <p>This story, however, paints a different tale. I'll spare you the details in exchange for captioned photos—yes, read the captions; they help tell the narrative. </p>

        <figcaption>This is the board game. Yes. I printed it out on matte-photo paper and mounted it to foamcore. Yes, everyone loved it. No, we did not play in class. Class was cancelled due to impending COVID scares. </figcaption>

      <p>For two weeks, I interviewed two fraternity brothers: my cousin and future-brother-in-law who are both chairmen at Georgia Tech's Sigma Alpha Epsilon. Both claim GT's SAE is every bit as rowdy as non-technology colleges. I'll take their word for it. If ever an Animal House did exist, it sits on Atlanta's 4th Street: vinyl floors peeling from rusted nails; lion gargoyles shattered on the lawn; beer cans, vodka handles, used contraceptives—all stuffed in walls where holes from broken drywall made convenient receptacles; roaches; rats; pee-stains; other fluids; asbestos; flip-flops (because staphylococcus is airborne); the cafeteria is the safest part of the house, below ground in the cellared basement where they all eat from ply-wood panels which double as beer-pong tables and raised dancing platforms.</p>

        <figcaption>These are these instructions, mimicked after the original Candy Land game. <strong>"The object of the game is to travel through Brandy Land along the path of colored spaces. The first player to reach Graduation wins the game."</strong></figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>I interviewed their historian, who is also my sister's boyfriend (whose name I've censored for courtesy). &quot;Mr. Staley,&quot; I ask—because surely he'll take my sister's last name. &quot;At what point in time did you decide you wanted to join a fraternity ... and why this fraternity?&quot; </p>

      <p>&quot;Yea,&quot; he said, nodding his head, thinking, forming his words. &quot;The fraternizing,&quot; was his answer. Ah, I replied. &quot;And the word is pretty nice.&quot; <em>The Word?</em> </p>

      <figure class="design-figure">
        <img src="../assets/imgs/bl-card-3.jpg" alt="Brandy Land Playing Card">
        <figcaption>Not all the cards are appropriate. In fact, some are much worse than this. College is for adults, afterall. Well, post-pubescents, anyways.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>&quot;What's the word?,&quot; I asked. </p>

      <p>&quot;Oh,&quot; he goes on to explain. Ya know, it's that archive all fraternities have. &quot;The archive of every test and assignment ever taken by any of the frat brothers.&quot; </p>

      <p>My jaw drops. What? &quot;Yea,&quot; he continues, explaining how—pretty much—they've known the questions to every exam, to every class, through all the years, for years on years on years. &quot;Don't get me wrong,&quot; he clarifies, &quot;... Georgia Tech tests are still impossibly hard, but it helps when all your older brothers have taken the tests ahead of you and can help you learn and prep the material in advance.&quot; </p>

        <figcaption>This playing card will take you to one of the board's eight location shortcuts. Be careful, though, because if you draw the same shortcut consecutively, you'll be forced to drop-out of college.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>This was an anthropology class, after all, so I did gather &quot;peer-reviewed&quot; data as well. But most of the &quot;professional&quot; data only confirmed the common fraternity tropes and assumptions: <em>fraternities drink more, have sex more, have lower GPAs, despite earning more money upon graduation; it's just one more advantage the white man has on the world.</em> &quot;It's true,&quot; my almost-brother-in-law said. Fraternities are for the privileged few. He was citing the expensive dues and their entirely white pledge-class. Then he continued, &quot;... but it's changing for the better: less hazing, less drinking, less STDs, safer drugs, more scholarships, and better grades and extracurricular activities.&quot; </p>

      <figure class="design-figure">
        <img src="../assets/imgs/bl-card-2.jpg" alt="Brandy Land Playing Card">
        <figcaption>Another card. My sister's sorority sisters—who were home for Spring Break—helped me cut all 60+ cards. They enjoyed the humor of it; I enjoyed their free labor.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>I interviewed my cousin the same weekend; he's the fraternity's rush chairman. I asked if he was rushing any black men to which he responded, thoughtfully, &quot;We're trying. It's hard. It's hard for them; it's hard for us. When it works,&quot; pausing to remember the one example when it worked, &quot;... when it works, it's because several black guys are rushed all at the same time. You can't rush just one guy. It's a start, but let's not forget, the entire frat scene is about ... well ... fraternizing; making connections; passing along the torch.&quot; </p>

      <figure class="design-figure">
        <img src="../assets/imgs/bl-card-4.jpg" alt="Brandy Land Playing Card">
        <figcaption>We had a long discussion about racial discrimination within greek life. And this was before the riots of 2020 and the countless murders which reignited the Black Lives Matter movement just months later.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>My cousin seemed to think it'd require rushing several black men simultaneously. &quot;If we could pledge just two or three black guys, we could use them as a springboard for future years. If each of them rushed three or four additional pledges the next year, who'd then rush their own three or four pledges the year after that, and then exponentially, hopefully, we'd have a fully diverse house after a couple years.&quot; The problem, he reminded me, is beginning. He closed, &quot;It's not easy convincing the current brothers—who are all white—to rush three or four black guys over three or four white guys who remind them of their former selves, trying their damndest to get a bid. And that's the hardest part for us; saying yes to a black kid means saying no to a white kid, something that hasn't happened in the history of the brotherhood. And that's assuming three or four black guys even want to rush. Would you rush a black fraternity as the only white kid?&quot; At that, he was late for his formal, and we adjourned the discourse. </p>

      <p>What remained of my research was a joke. Anecdotal stories corroborated the loose evidence gathered by research teams across the country. Greek life is an accelerator for those persons already in clear water, already full-steam ahead. </p>

      <figure class="design-figure">
        <img src="../assets/imgs/bl-card-5.jpg" alt="Brandy Land Playing Card">
        <figcaption>Some are just plain funny and really have nothing to do with research or stories. Some, perhaps, were even inspired by Mr. POTUS himself.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>Brandy Land, this parodied board game of the childhood classic, Candy Land, is an outrageous representation of measured greek-life data. Naturally, it's beautiful. I do go to SCAD, after all. My good friend Júlia—a former SCAD-grad herself—illustrated every cranny. However, &quot;It was Q,&quot; she'll remind you, &quot;who guided the entire project and art direction.&quot; She reminds me to remind you not because she wants to give me credit. She's reminding me to remind you so I will remind myself how particular I can be, and how much work this project required. Unfortunately, those illustrations of hers weren't the first rendition. This final draft is, at least, the third draft. Every element on that board was revised at least once. </p>

      <p>I'm sorry, Júlia. Truly. I don't deserve your patience for me.</p>
